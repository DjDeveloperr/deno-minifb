# deno minifb

This is a thin wrapper around [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/minifb) that you can use in deno. Combine it with [canvas](https://github.com/DjDeveloperr/deno-canvas) for native window that works like the [canvas web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) or [webgpu](https://deno.land/x/deno@v1.9.2/op_crates/webgpu) for 3D stuff.

> *WIP*: I am still working on it

## usage

```ts
// TODO
```

## development

You will need `deno`, `make`, and `cargo` (for rust) in your path. On mac or linux, run `make setup` to install everything you need.

Run `make` for some help.
